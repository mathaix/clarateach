# ClaraTeach Concept Overview (Plain Language)

## Purpose

ClaraTeach helps teachers run live, hands-on lessons where every learner gets a private practice space. Teachers can start a class, learners join with a code, and everything is removed afterward to keep costs low.

## The Two Parts

- **Always-on control part**: Runs all the time so teachers can create and manage classes.
- **Temporary workshop part**: Created only while a class is running.

## Always-on Control Part (runs all the time)

- **Teacher site**: The pages for creating a class, joining, and managing the session.
- **Class manager**: Starts and stops class machines, hands out seats, and helps learners rejoin.
- **Secure vault**: Keeps passwords and security secrets safe.

## Temporary Workshop Part (created per class)

- **Workshop machine**: A large shared computer that hosts all learner spaces for that class.
- **Front door**: Sends each learner to the right space and keeps access secure.
- **Learner space**: A private area with the learner's files and tools.
- **Live preview (optional)**: A view for checking what the learner is building in a browser.
- **Network helper (optional)**: Helps the live preview work on strict networks.

## A Simple Walkthrough

1. The teacher creates a class in the teacher site.
2. The system starts a fresh workshop machine.
3. Learners join with a class code and get their own seat.
4. Each learner is sent to their private space.
5. When the class ends, the workshop machine is removed.

## What We Care About

- **Privacy**: Learners are separated from each other.
- **Low cost**: The temporary part only runs during a class.
- **Smooth rejoin**: If a learner disconnects, they can return to the same seat.
